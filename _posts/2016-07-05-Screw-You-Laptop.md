*Warning: Stunts performed by crazy roboticist ! Don't try at home :P*

Recently both hinges of my laptop broke. I had practised the dark arts of laptop repair under the guidance of [ninjaduck](http://www.ninjaducks.in/) and [hackmaestro](https://hackmaster.in/blog/). And learned to use a lot of big toys in [robotics club](http://students.iitk.ac.in/roboclub/). This time I was going to combine these too to perform the ultimate laptop fix.  

First things first. Getting the right tools. Any task becomes a breeze when you have the right tools to do it. Luckily I had robotics club and magic drawer at my disposal.
Wait! Let me tell you about the magic drawer. Hackmaestro has a drawer right above his seat in lab which has all the gadgets you could ever think of. And I mean it. Really. From laptop repair tools to kindle to nfc tags. Whats the last coding book you searched for ? I bet its there in that drawer. Its like a real life implementation of doremon's pocket!
Anyways I got what I needed. ![laptop-repair-tools](/img/posts/laptop-repair-tools.jpg)

Both the hinges were jam in there position due to dust. I figured this was the reason why it broke. When I tried to close the screen instead of moving with the hinge it just broke off. And now the structure to hold the hinge in place was gone. I tried to loosen the hinge nut so that the hinge is movable again but it seemed that had been jammed too! Maybe it requires a little more torque. So I switched to a bigger tool. But still no luck. Now I got frustrated. I came back with the biggest wrench the club had. ![laptop-repair-tools](/img/posts/nut-crackers.jpg)

This time it shifted a little and when back to stuck again. After 10 minutes of sweating and cursing I figured was rotating it in the wrong direction! ![poker-face](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-P0jLdct71dQ/T_68DtdyVJI/AAAAAAAAA1E/KsLqdOZrb_A/s1600/Face+palm.jpg)

Well, once I recovered from that disappointment, I gathered up to courage to actually do the deed. I was gonna drill through the plastic behind the hinge, where once the hinge supporting structure used to be. This felt really exciting! I was a little nervous about it, since I could potentially damage my laptop permanently. It felt like I was back in Xth standard, partitioning my hardisk to dual boot. Or when I rooted my first android the following year. I guess I like jumping into these situations :D
I didn't mess up this time. ![drilled-laptop](/img/posts/drilled-laptop.jpg)

Finding bolt in robotics club is easy but finding a fitting nut is near impossible! I though I would have to go to the market to get the correct size, but you can always recycle parts from old robots. I hope the old chess playing robot team does read this blog :P
This is what it looks like now ![laptop-finished-front](/img/posts/laptop-finished-front.jpg)  
![laptop-finished-back](/img/posts/laptop-finished-back.jpg) Its not the neatest design. But it looks cool. :)
