description: This is a secret project being worked on via <a href="https://github.com/hackcave">hackcave hackers</a>. I have spend more time on this that all the other projects (other that auv) combined. I am probably not allowed to mention this project to anyone, so please don't tell anyone that I told you :P This is perhaps the first professional code that I have written. Its has taught me to appreciate code design and software architecture. Its about 6k lines of java code. Some of the things used in this project are Retrofit2, Dagger2, Jenkins CI, Google Support Libraries, Stetho, Reactive Java, Pretty Time, HtmlTextView. We are following MVVM to structure our code.
